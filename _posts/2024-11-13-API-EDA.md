title: A Non-Comprehensive Look at APIs and Data Collection
description: Collecting data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and performing exploratory data analysis on it.

# Introduction

While I was searching for interesting datasets, I came across the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which is a collection of data on fatal car crashes across the United States. I thought it would be interesting to conduct exploratory data analysis on this data, specifically focusing on the state of Utah since that is where I currently live. I wanted the most recent data so I only used observations from 2022.

### Questions of Interest

The questions I was most interested in answering from this data were the following:

1. Which day of the week had the highest number of crashes?

2. What type of weather resulted in the highest average number of fatalities?

3. How are lighting condition, population type, and number of car crashes related?

I believe that these questions could provide some insight into the underlying factors that contributed to the car crashes and consequent fatalities in Utah in 2022.

### Data Collection

Before I could perform any analysis on this data, I had to collect it first. The NHTSA does have an [online tool](https://cdan.dot.gov/query) for exploring this data, but I chose to use their [API](https://crashviewer.nhtsa.dot.gov/CrashAPI) instead so that I could pull the data into Python to be able to answer my specific questions. This data is free and public for anyone to use, so my use of it is ethical and permissible. Feel free to explore the data available for yourself, as well!

I won’t be sharing my code in this blog post, but if you want to learn more about how I used this API and compiled my data, visit my GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/darianrd/Accident-Data). However, I will explain a little bit about how to get started with a project like this.

The most important step for using any API is to reference its documentation, since all APIs will vary in how information is to be extracted, how many requests can be made, and whether it uses an API key. Unfortunately, this API does not offer much documentation, but it is fairly straightforward to use and doesn’t require an API key. For the data I collected, I made a request using the URL provided in the documentation, specified the year and the state of interest, and then set up a for loop to collect all of the observations for those parameters. 

A lot of the time, the information collected from APIs can be messy, or at least not in form that you’re hoping for. Pulling API data into Python makes this easy to fix with a plethora of data cleaning capabilities. For my dataset, I removed a lot of unnecessary variables, changed the variable names to be more intuitive, and dummy encoded the hospital variable. The CSV file for my final dataset can be found in my GitHub repository.

### Exploring the Data

Now we can start the fun part—summarizing and visualizing the data so that we can draw conclusions from it.

The total number of observations for my dataset was 465. The summary statistics for fatalities can are shown in the following table:

![Summary Stats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darianrd/StatBlog/3fd9ce1ac41e11236ac2f5f879fcf4967e951589/assets/img/Summary%20Stats.png)

Additionally, counts for each of the categorical variables are shown in the following figure (for brevity, county and city have been reduced to the top 10 values):

![Count Stats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darianrd/StatBlog/3fd9ce1ac41e11236ac2f5f879fcf4967e951589/assets/img/Count%20Stats.png)

To address my question about which day of the week had the highest number of crashes, I created a simple histogram.

![Histogram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darianrd/StatBlog/3fd9ce1ac41e11236ac2f5f879fcf4967e951589/assets/img/API%20Histogram.png)

This graph, along with the summary statistics above, show that Saturday was the day with the highest amount of crashes. This seems logical, since more people tend to go out and about on the weekend.

For my next question about what type of weather yielded the highest average number of fatalities, I created a heat map with the different levels represented as the average number of fatalities. 

![Heat Map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darianrd/StatBlog/3fd9ce1ac41e11236ac2f5f879fcf4967e951589/assets/img/API%20Heat%20Map.png)

Since the fatalities in this dataset only range from 1 to 2, these numbers don’t seem like they vary much from one another. However, it does seem like severe crosswinds do have a significantly higher fatality rate than any other category. It is important to note, though, that there were only 6 observations in this category, so this may not be enough information to draw any definitive conclusions. Additionally, although clear and cloudy weather conditions seem like they are associated with a slightly higher fatality rate, in looking at the summary statistics above, we can see that those two categories had the most observations. Therefore, it is not particularly helpful—and may not be very accurate—to draw any conclusions about those two categories in comparison to the others.

For my last question about the relationship between lighting conditions, population type, and number of crashes, I created a barplot based on lighting conditions and separated into rural and urban areas.

![Barplot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darianrd/StatBlog/3fd9ce1ac41e11236ac2f5f879fcf4967e951589/assets/img/API%20Barplot.png)

Interestingly, it seems that more crashes were observed for daylight conditions for both rural and urban areas, but that urban areas experienced significantly more crashes in the daylight than rural areas. Meanwhile, both areas experienced about the same amount of crashes in the dark with no lighting. It is likely that rural areas in Utah do not typically have external light sources on the road, hence why there are no observations for rural areas in the dark with lighting. Again, it’s important to note that as displayed in the summary statistics above, the number of urban observations is quite a bit higher than rural observations, so any difference in number of car crashes for the two areas may be explained by that.

While this data is far from perfect, I feel that it is still helpful in getting a better picture of the conditions involved in car crashes in Utah.
