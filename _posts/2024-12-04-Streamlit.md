title: The Only App Youâ€™ll Ever Need (For Analyzing Car Crash Data in Utah in 2022)
description: Creating and explaining a Streamlit app for analyzing the FARS data from my last blog post.
---

# Introduction
In my last blog post, I discussed a dataset that I compiled from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) API, and in this post we will be exploring the data through a Streamlit app that I created to display the data I collected. I focused on the same questions as I did in the last post:

1. Which day of the week had the highest number of crashes?

2. What type of weather resulted in the highest average number of fatalities?

3. How are lighting condition, population type, and number of car crashes related?
